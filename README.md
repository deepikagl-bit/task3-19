Task 3 – Networking Basics for Cyber Security
Tools Used:

Wireshark

Objective:

To understand basic networking concepts and analyze live network traffic using packet sniffing tools.

Concepts Learned:

TCP Handshake

TCP handshake is a 3-step process used to establish a connection between client and server.

Steps:

SYN

SYN-ACK

ACK

This ensures reliable communication.

Difference Between TCP and UDP

TCP is reliable and connection-oriented

UDP is faster but unreliable

TCP is used for web browsing and emails

UDP is used for streaming and gaming

DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS converts domain names into IP addresses

Example: google.com → 142.250.x.x

Observed DNS queries in Wireshark

Packet Sniffing

Packet sniffing means capturing and analyzing network packets

Wireshark is used to monitor network traffic

Helps in cybersecurity analysis and troubleshooting

HTTP vs HTTPS

HTTP sends data in plain text

HTTPS encrypts data using SSL/TLS

HTTPS is more secure than HTTP

Practical Work Done:

Installed Wireshark

Captured live network traffic

Applied filters:

TCP

DNS

HTTP

Observed TCP three-way handshake

Captured DNS queries

Identified difference between encrypted and unencrypted traffic

Files Included in Repository:

Packet capture file (.pcap)

Screenshots of Wireshark analysis

README.md report

Outcome:

This task helped me gain practical knowledge of:

How network traffic works

How packets flow between client and server

How attackers can analyze insecure traffic

Basics of network monitoring using Wireshark
